# Webscraping train accidents from Wikipedia

This project is divided into 4 parts in four notebooks.

**Notebook 1: Webscraping**
**Notebook 2: Cleaning data**
**Notebook 3: Enriching data**
**Notebook 4: Visualising data**

## Objective for this project
1. Data Gathering: Crawl all Wikipedia articles on railway accidents,
     using the corresponding page for 1815 as a starting point: 
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Railway_accidents_in_1815
     
2. Find a strategy to exclude articles that do not directly refer to accidents.

3. Data Storage: Store the retrieved information in a CSV file. For each railway accident 
     store the following information in columns: 
       - Date
       - Location
       - Coordinates (if available)
       - Cause
      - Number of deaths
